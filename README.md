# Overview

This project is intended for me to use new knowledge on objects and regular 
expressions to create a login system. This login system will validate form 
fields and let a user access a car portal only once their information matches
the regular expressions. Once logged in the user should be able to hover over
different car images to see different facts.


## Learning

**Regular expressions** - I wanted to create a set of regular expressions that would validate the various input fields. Prior to this project I had no knowledge on regular expressions, so I had to research to find out what was required. I practiced my knowledge using online tools, such as https://regexr.com/ and https://regex101.com/ so that I was confident my regular expressions were correct.

**Objects** - I wanted to start using objects more and gain experience using them in JavaScript. To do this I researched objects, how to create them, how to access them and change them. This allowed me to store my regular expressions in one object and check which regular expression I was going to use.


## Issues

**Debugging** - as I started to use my new knowledge I had to debug problems. This involved looking online and researching problems to find any appropriate fixes. I also used the inspect tool on the page and console.log pieces of code to ensure the code was executing as intended.
